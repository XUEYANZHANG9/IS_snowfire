    "1. RH. Deriving RH from specific humidity (approximating the mixing ratio w as q) \n",
    "2. Climate class. The NFDRS method uses climate class to approximate a precipitation rate, which is 0.25 in/hr for climate classes 1 and 2 and 0.05 in/hr for climate classes 3 and 4. The amount of variability in daily DFM is very dependent on this. The precip rate is then used to determine the precip duration, which cannot exceed 8 hours if this method is used. \n",

I compared for one gridcell located in the WA Cascades, with slightly different resolutions between the UI Metdata DFM and Integrated Scenarios. I coded this up in Python (Ipython notebook available for reference). \n",

    "I should mention that this was done for one water year, 1982, and one gridcell, as previously mentioned.\n",

To further isolate potential issues with deriving RH from q, I then tried using RHmax and RHmin from UI Metdata as inputs instead of deriving RH from q. All of these results are shown below.

    "** ISSUES TO FLAG ** \n",
    "1. Variability is very sensitive to WETRAT (precip rate in in/hr). This is dependent on the climate class. Although variability is smaller for the climate class used here (2), the correlations are higher. \n",
    "2. The correlation improves when UI Metdata Inputs with RHmin and RHmax are used. This highlights possible problems with my estimation of RH. Additionally, there are times when RH > 100 in my algorithm, which obviously doesn't make sense. \n",
