    "** INTRODUCTION ** \n",
    "\n",
    "We have been writing a paper on climate change impacts on snowpack and fire risk in the western United States using simulations from the Integrated Scenarios project. The domain for the paper includes five mountain ranges (Cascades, Sierra Nevada, Northern Rockies, Southern Rockies, White Mountains) and six lowland regions (Missouri Basin, Coastal North, Coastal South, Lower Colorado, Great Basin, and Northwest Interior). To understand climate impacts on fire and to tie this into changes in snowpack, we have been looking at dead fuel moisture. Our goal is to compute 100-hr and 1000-hr time lags of dead fuel moisture (DFM) and to look at changes in DFM between the 2020s and 2080s. "

    "These are necessary because available archived data from Integrated Scenarios includes maximum and minimum temperature, specific humidity, and precipitation (and not relative humidity). \n",
    "\n",
    "1. RH. Deriving RH from specific humidity (approximating the mixing ratio w as q). \n",
    "2. Climate class. The NFDRS method uses climate class to approximate a precipitation rate, which is 0.25 in/hr for climate classes 1 and 2 and 0.05 in/hr for climate classes 3 and 4. The amount of variability in daily DFM is very dependent on this. The precip rate is then used to determine the precip duration, which cannot exceed 8 hours if this method is used. \n",
    "3. SATVPD. Using saturation vapor pressure evaluated at the average daily temperature rather than observed temperature (dry-bulb temperature of afternoon observation time). \n",
    "4. AMBVP. Using average RH (derived from q) rather than observed RH. \n",
    "5. EMC. Using Tmin for dew point temperature and RH (derived from q). "

    "To understand how the algorithm for 100-hr DFM was performing, I imported 100-hr DFM data available through UI Metdata to compare with my algorithm for DFM. I compared for one gridcell located in the WA Cascades, with slightly different resolutions between the UI Metdata DFM (4 km) and Integrated Scenarios (6 km). I coded this up in Python (Ipython notebook available for reference) and did the comparison for one water year (1982). \n",

    "1. Variability is very sensitive to WETRAT (precip rate in in/hr). This is dependent on the climate class. Although variability is smaller for the climate class used here (2), the correlations are higher. For example, if the climate class is changed to class 3, and precip rate is 0.05 in/hr (instead of 0.25 in/hr as used here), the variability changes dramatically (see figure below). ![100-hr DFM6](dfm_comparison_one_gridcell_climclass3.png) However, the correlations are much lower; the maximum correlation from above (UI Metdata DFM compared with my algorithm using UI Metdata inputs with RH) is only 0.60. \n",
    "2. The correlation improves when UI Metdata Inputs with RHmin and RHmax are used. This highlights possible problems with my estimation of RH. Additionally, there are times when RH > 100 in my algorithm, which obviously doesn't make sense. \n",
    "3. EMC values for my algorithm do seem a bit high based on the literature, but this might not be unreasonable. "
